						<h2>Definition and Context</h2>
						<p>
                            Our tracking is by product in the Work Effort view vs. capability which helps me to understand by product where we are spending our time/money.  I would like to describe to you how the time spent in these product correlates to value in capabilities being developed and deployed to the Enterprise. Continue down for more detail.

						<h2>Application and Asset Discovery -- $255k</h2>
						<p>
                            <font color='red'><b>uCMDB, Troux, PM Sprints, HP Universal Discovery, FNMP</b></font> - All of these products and aligned effort was focused on delivering Application and Asset Discovery capabilities.  We built some proto-types of dependency mapping, enhanced compute and data accuracy, aligned new capacity and developed a roadmap/strategy to advance the capability.  
                        </p>

                <section>
						<h2>Automation and Event Management (Central IT) -- $400k</h2>
						<p>
                            <font color='red'><b>Patrol, xMatters, BPPM, SCOM, PM Oversight, CA Spectrum, SCRUM Master</b></font>.  This was a focus area in 2014 where we collaborated with Hosting teams to implement closed loop automation and further instrument CI level KPI's that participate in automation through Remedy and xMatters.  This ultimately reduced MTTR in several areas and saved in excess of 20FTE which were re-directed to offset other areas of the org.

						<p>
                            <font color='red'><b>CA APM, HP BSM, CA App Delivery Analysis, New Relic</b></font>.  We spent a lot of time building out new Introscope environments and implementing self-service to the markets.  We added a network transparent module to APM providing deeper network disgnostics.  Also we moved the HP Synthetics solution to full SaaS retiring over $1m in existing contracts over the three year term of the new contract.

						<p>
                            <font color='red'><b>EXC!TE, Splunk, CA CAPMON</b></font>.  We spent $31k on our innovation/hackathon to design Next Generation Service Assurance through <a href="https://myconnections.lmig.com/groups/excite">Exc!te</a>.  Additionally we put some effort and focus on centralizing a Splunk (self-service) environment and ran a POC of CA's Capacity tool which didn't yield a positive result.

						<h2>Definition and Context</h2>
						<p>
                            Our tracking in the maintenance space is a little more deliberate, but also requires some context to drill into for better understanding of how the costs align to capabilities and work that is yielding a return to the organization.  I will not hide the fact that we can do far better in streamlining and partnering with outside organizations on further reducing our maintenance cost.

						<h2>Vendor Management -- $220k</h2>
						<p>

This is unnacceptable and will be one area that we cut back on dramatically in 2015.  I don't like dealing with vendors as it is, so to know that it cost the company over $200k in 2014 is crazy..

						<h2>Core Infra (HW) support (300+ servers) -- $300k</h2>

                            <font color='red'><b>BMC Suite, HP Suite, Splunk, xMatters, SCOM, CA Suite, Troux</b></font>.  This includes HW refresh, vulnerability remediations, consolidations, rebuilds, Incident Management.

						<p>
                            <font color='red'><b>BMC Suite, HP Suite, Splunk, xMatters, SCOM, CA Suite, Troux</b></font>.  This includes Agent configs, trap configurations, software upgrades and implementations, script management, Incident Management.  We have shifted some of the agent config work to support organizations in the markets in 2014 via self-service capabilities.  Those savings in Service Assurance were redirected to development.

						<h2>Team -- $60 - $100k</h2>
						<p>
                            I capture all 1:1 and team meeting time in this cost category under maintenance.  14 people * 1:1 weekly for 30min = roughly $30k.  I ran a weekly team meeting for an hour for about 3/4 of the year and now run it bi-weekly = roughly $53k, then random team events, etc.. make up the difference.  My opinion is that this is the most important investement of them all !!

						<h2>Scoping - 1st Viable Release</h2>
						<p>
                            We will need to establish a date for a 1st viable release of our own DataHUB with some real use cases.  Would love Q1, but we shall see what capacity looks like.  <font color='red'>I will be looking for venture capitalists to invest in this vision... </font>

						<h2>Team</h2>
						<p>
                            We will be shifting focus and scaling back in areas where we are not making a material impact ont he future state of Service Assurance.  Allow customers to regain that control they are looking for and demonstrate the value in the data.

						<h2>Industry Alignment / Collaboration</h2>
						<p>
                            We need to start working outside of Liberty Mutual with partner companies that have a similar focus to streamline performance data delivery through open source tooling and proflieration of OPEN data consumption for the purposes of performance management.  This path is disruptive to the industry and Liberty should play a role in driving this model in the industry as it helps us both influence the direction of the platform and save Liberty a lot of money in the process.
